#### BookingBug AngularJS SDK

This SDK will enable you to build rich web apps that utilize the BookingBug
API. Included in the examples directory are HTML pages that demonstrate the
various directives. They are using mocks rather than the actual API. Just
remove MockE2E from the ng-app attribute and replace the values of the
directive attributes to use with live data.

To install required dependencies run:

`npm install`

`bower install`

To start the server and watch files for changes run:

`npm start`

The examples are then accessible at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
